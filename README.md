## Japanese Verb Conjugations 

This project is created to improve my HTML, CSS (Flex and Grid) and JavaScript skills. Also, with this project, I aimed to contribute to my Japanese skills and to create a page that explains Japanese verb conjugations in Turkish. 

In this project:
 - Created an accordion and added the tables within it
 - Used the [Ruby Annotation](https://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-ruby-20010531/Overview.html.utf-8) for Japanese words
 - Added a scroll back to the top button and made it interactive with JavaScript DOM events
